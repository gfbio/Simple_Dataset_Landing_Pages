	"details":"This dataset contains the continuous reading of the 8 different status parameters from a Flux Capacitor that was used to power a DeLorean based time machine from October 26, 1985 back to November 5, 1955. The time granularity for all parameters is one reading every 0.1 seconds for the duration of the travel. After arriving in 1955 the Flux Capacitor was in low power mode, taking a reading every hour until the return to 1985 7 days later.",
